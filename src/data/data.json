                "I worked as a Full Stack Developer at a company managing real estate platforms across multiple countries. On the B2B side, I was responsible for developing a back-office system used by real estate agents to manage their property listings. Agents could add, edit, modify and publish rental or sale properties, which were then propagated to multiple public websites. I built the frontend using React.js and Redux, and developed backend features with PHP (Symfony) and MariaDB. I also wrote unit and integration tests with Jest and PHPUnit. Some of the core features I implemented included property status workflows, image uploading and gallery management, multi-language support for international listings..",
                "On the B2C side, I worked on real estate portals like Hipflat and DotProperty. My role focused on maintaining and refactoring backend features in Ruby on Rails, with MongoDB for data storage. These platforms allowed users to search and filter properties by location, price, and other criteria. I also improved data synchronization services between different property sources and optimized backend endpoints to enhance performance. Throughout both projects, I worked closely with cross-functional teams, maintained code quality standards, and contributed to scalable, production-ready systems."

I was responsible for designing the UI canvas, implementing interactive elements in C#, and integrating them into the VR experience. Users wearing a wired VR headset  could navigate the virtual operating room and follow step-by-step protocols, including hand sanitization, equipment selection, and preparation for surgery. I also conducted manual testing of each implemented feature, in-headset testing, and logging tools. My tasks included identifying and documenting bugs, reporting them through a tracking system like Jira, and verifying fixes to ensure a smooth and realistic user experience."
